The first verse sets the scene for the song, with the idea that the singer is a wandering soul who is stuck in a world where everything is the same – much like the life of a nomad, where they live in a repetitive cycle. The line ‘Every day, it seems we're wastin' away’ suggests a life of meaningless and purposelessness. The second verse details the loneliness that comes with the outlaw lifestyle, with the people the singer meets always leaving and the bottle being a constant companion. The chorus ‘I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride’ is a metaphor for the singer’s guitar, and this likening himself to a cowboy on a motorcycle is perhaps an extension of the Wild West outlaw persona.</p><br><p>The last verse tells of the singer’s triumphs as a musical outlaw, claiming to have been ‘everywhere’ and ‘seen a million faces and rocked them all’. This suggests that the life of the outlaw isn’t always a sad and lonely one but can be a thrilling adventure. Throughout the song, the chorus repeats with the words ‘Wanted dead or alive’, a phrase that speaks to the idea of the outlaw being a target of the law – where it feels like the only options are to either die or to carry on living their life as a rebel. Ultimately, the lyrics of “Wanted Dead or Alive” relate to the idea of freedom, where the life of an outlaw is one that is independent and free from the constraints of society.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>It's all the same, only the names will change</u><br>Despite the different names, everything is essentially the same.</p><br><p><u>Every day, it seems we're wastin' away</u><br>Every day, it feels like we are losing little pieces of ourselves.</p><br><p><u>Another place where the faces are so cold</u><br>Yet another location where the people are distant and disconnected.</p><br><p><u>I'd drive all night just to get back home</u><br>I would go to any lengths, even if it means driving through the night, to return to the comfort of my own home.</p><br><p><u>I'm a cowboy</u><br>I am a wanderer and an outsider.</p><br><p><u>On a steel horse I ride</u><br>I travel on a motorcycle, which is my only means of escaping the mundane.</p><br><p><u>I'm wanted dead or alive</u><br>I am constantly being pursued, either figuratively or literally.</p><br><p><u>Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days</u><br>Occasionally I rest, but at times I am awake for days on end.</p><br><p><u>The people I meet always go their separate ways</u><br>The individuals I interact with always end up living their separate lives.</p><br><p><u>Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink</u><br>On certain days, the only way to track the time is by how often you turn to alcohol.</p><br><p><u>And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think</u><br>When you find yourself by yourself, all you can do is reflect and contemplate.</p><br><p><u>'Cause I'm a cowboy</u><br>As a wanderer, I am a cowboy.</p><br><p><u>I got the night on my side</u><br>The nocturnal hours are when I feel most alive and free.</p><br><p><u>And I walk these streets, a loaded six-string on my back</u><br>I wander around with a guitar on my back, keeping it close and ready for whenever inspiration strikes.</p><br><p><u>I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back</u><br>I perform with urgency because my future is uncertain and my life is always at risk.</p><br><p><u>I've been everywhere, still I'm standing tall</u><br>Although I've traveled far and wide, I have remained resolute and unbroken.</p><br><p><u>I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all</u><br>I have performed in front of countless people and have succeeded in thrilling them all.</p><br><p><u>And I ride (and I ride), dead or alive</u><br>Whether I am alive or dead, I will continue to travel on.</p><br><p><u>I still drive (I still drive), dead or alive</u><br>Even if I am not alive, I will still find a way to continue driving forward.</p><br><p><u>Dead or alive</u><br>No matter what state I am in, I will not give up.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: Jon Bon Jovi, Richard S Sambora</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maHqfo6yLu9Will5qZpSgtrPAq6OappRkpKK6056bmHyVlrGgu9GYeKWhppqsabjIr5yYe32JrIS%2Bzqyqq6eRmcBq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./swept-away-by-an-unusual-destiny-in-the-blue-sea-of-august-1976.html><span>←</span><span>Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August movie review (1976)</span></a>
