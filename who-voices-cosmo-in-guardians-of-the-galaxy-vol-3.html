Cosmo is voiced by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maria Bakalova</a> whose voice you may recognise if you’ve got a good ear.</p><h3 id=h-where-do-we-know-her-from data-injectable=false>Where do we know her from?</h3><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Her first widely recognised appearance was as Borat’s daughter in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Subsequent Moviefilm</a> for which she received a huge deal of praise from fans who loved her character. She even won a critics choice award for best supporting actress as well as being nominated for multiple other awards for the breakout role.</p><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=840 data-injectable=true>Since Borat 2 she has appeared in a few well known comedies including the comedy slasher film, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bodies, Bodies, Bodies</a> as well as Judd Apatow comedy: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bubble.</a> As for her future, she has plenty of work lined up including another gig with Guardians director, James Gunn. She is set to voice a character from the new DCU in the upcoming animated series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Creature Commandos.</a> The show will follow a lesser known team from DC and it’s set to release sometime in 2024 although there is no specific date at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Bakalova will provide the voice for Ilana Rostivic, a new character created especially for the DCU Creature Commandos series. As is the norm for Gunn by now, he’s continuing the trend of making a home for his Marvel family over at DC. Aside from that, she has plenty of other live-action work coming up soon including a role alongside <a href=#>Eva Green</a> in the action film, Dirty Angels.</p><h3 id=h-will-she-return-to-voice-cosmo data-injectable=false>Will she return to voice Cosmo?</h3><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=751 data-injectable=false>Although nothing has been confirmed as of right now, it’s very possible that Bakalova could return to voice the character once more. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney has kept pretty quiet about the future of the Guardians</a>, but it’s likely we will see Gunn’s version of these characters pop up again from time to time. So it’s more than possible we could see Bakalova return to voice Cosmo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahpmaun56wpr%2BMnKaspZ9itq95xq6Yq5yZlru0ec6fZK2glWK0orjAsbBmrp%2BhenR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./day-of-the-locust-1975.html><span>←</span><span>Day of the Locust movie review (1975)</span></a>
