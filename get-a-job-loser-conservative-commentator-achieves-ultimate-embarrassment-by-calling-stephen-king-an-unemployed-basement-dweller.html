It’s fair enough to be bamboozled on complex issues like how to solve bipartisanism in the political sphere, or how to make sure school funding is used efficiently, but there are simply too many far-right talking heads and politicians who make mistakes or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">display an ignorance that’s beyond embarrassing</a>. Yet, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Bongino</a></strong> appears to have really hit the idiocy jackpot with his latest reply to famously prolific author <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen King</a>.</strong></p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yeah, you’re right. Millions of listeners a day on a podcast while you’re watching porn in your momma’s basement yearning for the days that people actually gave a shit about your dumb ass. Nice comeback dipshit. Get a job loser.</p>— Dan Bongino (@dbongino) <a href=#>May 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=934 data-injectable=true>The former NYPD cop, multiple-times failed Republican politician, and conspiracy theory spreading podcaster has a long history of tweeting hysterically about Joe Biden, which he sometimes even does multiple times a day. In this case, he described the president as “an embarrassment to the human race in every respect,” which is a pretty funny way for him to relate to the man in the Oval Office after American conservatives spent four years claiming everyone who was mildly critical of Trump were deranged whiners. But avoiding hypocrisy hasn’t been important to right-wingers in the States for quite some time now.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Biden is a disgrace to humankind. An embarrassment to the human race in every respect.</p>— Dan Bongino (@dbongino) <a href=#>May 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>Overly emotional tweets and comments from thought leaders on the same side of the political spectrum as Bongino are nothing new, especially after the tumult of the Trump years, but it was only after Stephen King replied jokingly that at least Biden had a “real job” that the ex-cop unleashed a typed-tantrum that was so incoherent it might as well have been in windings.</p><p data-characters=888 data-current-count=888 data-injectable=true>Whether or not you consider an author to be a real job (and Bongino does, seeing as he came to prominence after writing a book about his time in the secret service, and has since written a further one that hit the NYT Best sellers list, albeit with a note pointing out that most of the sales were from bulk buying – a tactic that the right wing sphere has been using successfully since the 70s and the career of Phyllis Schlafly), if there is any writer who’s really putting in the hours, it’s King. The horror legend is notoriously prolific, having written over 70 full-length books and more than 200 short stories in his long-spanning career. And, although we can’t exactly vouch for King’s economic status, we think it’s fair to say that he probably isn’t living in his mother’s basement. Bongino’s fans, however, very well may be.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>It’s also fair to say plenty of people do still care about King and his work, especially given an adaptation of Salem’s Lot is due out soon, and the It franchise has killed it at the box office in recent years.</p><p data-characters=568 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>This isn’t the first time in recent days that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">King has made fun of Bongino</a> and his hysteria, although this time the writer seems to have really hit a nerve. While Bongino is hardly a calm presence, he isn’t often reduced to an out and out spew like this, which may explain why it made such little sense. Other commenters were pretty keen to point out just how silly the right wing podcast host’s response was, with one even referring to the author as a “living legend in the west,” and others noting how prolific the writer from Maine is.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>that was the best you had ? To give a living legend in the West , maybe the best horror author ever a " get a job" post ? Lol hundreds of years from now , people will know stephen king.

Stephen King is so prolific, he publishes some novels under pseudonyms. He has sold more than 400 million volumes. I think we can call him gainfully employed.</p>— barskin 🇺🇦 I Stand With Ukraine 🇺🇦 (@barskin) <a href=#>May 11, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I mean, we all know Stephen King. Who is Dongerino?</p>— Steven Spohn (Spawn) (@stevenspohn) <a href=#>May 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=656 data-current-count=956 data-injectable=true>Bongino isn’t exactly known for being the most logical or reasonable pundit. In 2018,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> he even stated that</a> “[his] entire life right now is about owning the libs,” which is always a healthy way to look at issues. He’s also, unsurprisingly, a big advocate of the dangerous lie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that the 2020 election was rigged</a>, as well as a number of other classic conspiracy theories that seem to have made their way into the heart of conservative American thought, like spreading covid misinformation. The funniest thing is, today he’s immediately gotten back on the Biden hate train with another tweet, showing his obsession is far from over.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Today is May 11th, and Joe Biden is the WORST president in US history.</p>— Dan Bongino (@dbongino) <a href=#>May 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=false>King is yet to reply to this tweet, but here’s to hoping he takes some time out from his mother’s basement to do so, because we have no doubt it will lead to some more hilarious interactions. Or, if Bongino wants a safe space, he could always just head to Parler, which he allegedly owns part of.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S0psCMmmSjp5JiubC%2FxKtknKeeqLKzwsCtoK%2BdXZi8rrnEp6uarJ%2BneqKvx6Kcr52jYsKtwMimmK2dXZq6o63Rq5isq52au7V5wbJknJmcobavs4ysq56omJq7brfIp55mmZ5iwq%2BxzKmjqLGVmXqjrdKepJ6mpGKxuLHLpZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cactus-moser-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Cactus Moser Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
