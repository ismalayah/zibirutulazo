Some of them are with musicians — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as is the newly announced Lady Gaga collab</a> — while others include NBA legends. Ultimately, it wouldn’t be too far-fetched if the new season of Fortnite included a collaboration with Shonen Jump or Toei Animation, finally bringing One Piece onto Spring Lands — though the stakes would be higher than ever.</p><h2 id=h-is-one-piece-collaborating-with-fortnite data-injectable=false>Is One Piece collaborating with Fortnite?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/One-Piece-Luffy-Dressrosa.jpg><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=799 data-injectable=true>Long story short: we’re not yet sure <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">if One Piece is coming to Fortnite in Chapter 5</a>, but there is a reason why fans believe the Straw Hats may soon join the Epic Games’ collaboration roster. For starters, the rumors of a crossover began when Donald Mustard, before leaving Epic, changed his Twitter online location to “The Blue Ocean,” followed by a video of himself standing in front of the sea. Though small, these allusions to the blue ocean did not go unnoticed by fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>On the most recent <a href=#>@XboxEra</a> Podcast, a rumor has been mentioned that One Piece is set to come to <a href=#>#Fortnite</a> in the future. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nFMLapWGPr</a></p>— iFireMonkey (@iFireMonkey) <a href=#>February 11, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=false>Moreover, in the XboxEra podcast, it was also shared that the upcoming Fortnite collaboration would indeed be with One Piece. While this may be nothing but speculation, leaks from XboxEra often turn out to be true. However, at this exact point in time, there is no official confirmation from Epic Games that an upcoming collaboration is imminent, nor is it confirmed to be with One Piece specifically. But hey, they’ve done Jujutsu Kaisen, My Hero Academia, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and Attack on Titan</a> — what’s one more?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZooKxln6OybrzInpqeZZOkuqq6xmarqGWWpL%2B1usitnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-voices-cosmo-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3.html><span>←</span><span>Who voices Cosmo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3?</span></a>
