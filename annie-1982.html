<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Annie movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1982)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The adventures she gets herself into are likewise questionable. I've never thought of "Oliver!" as a particularly realistic musical, but at least when its little hero said "Please, sir, more food?" there was a hint of truth. "Annie" has been plunged into pure fantasy, into the mindless sort of musical boosterism that plays big for Broadway theater parties but almost always translates to the movie screen as sheer contrivance. "Annie" is not about anything. It contains lots of subjects (such as cruel orphanages, the Great Depression, scheming conmen, heartless billionaires, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt) but it isn't about them. It's not even really about whether Annie will survive her encounters with them, since the book of this musical is so rigorously machine-made, so relentlessly formula, it's one of those movies where you can amaze your friends by leaving the auditorium, standing blindfolded in the lobby and correctly predicting the outcome.</p><p>And yet I sort of enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed the energy that was visible on the screen, and the sumptuousness of the production numbers, and the good humor of several of the performances -- especially those by <a href=#>Albert Finney</a>, as Daddy Warbucks, and <a href=#>Carol Burnett</a>, as the wicked orphanage supervisor, Miss Hannigan. Aileen Quinn sort of grew on me, too. She cannot be said to really play a child --at least not the sort of plausible flesh-and-blood child that <a href=#>Henry Thomas</a> creates in "<a href=#>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial</a>" But Quinn is talented, can dance well and sing passably, and does not seem to be an overtrained puppet like, say, <a href=#>Ricky Schroder</a>. She seems more like the kind of kid who will get this acting out of her system and go on to be student body president.</p><p>If there is a center to the film, it belongs to Albert Finney. He has a thankless task: He must portray Daddy Warbucks as a self-centered, smug rich man who has everything in the world, except love, and who learns to love through the example of a little girl. This is the sort of role actors kill over -- to avoid playing. Albert Finney has the true grit. He's gone through this personality transformation twice; he starred in "<a href=#>Scrooge</a>" in 1970. This time, he even pulls it off, by underplaying. He isn't too aloof at the beginning, and he's not too softhearted at the end. He has a certain detachment. Annie may win his heart, but she'll still have to phone for an appointment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46apaehlWJ%2BeoSR</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-ateez-members-ages-confirmed.html><span>←</span><span>All ATEEZ members ages, confirmed</span></a>
