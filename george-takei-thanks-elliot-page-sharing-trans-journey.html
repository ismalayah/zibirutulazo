In terms of the actual quality of the response, it was what I expected: love and support from many people and hatred and cruelty and vitriol from so many others. I came out as gay in 2014, and it’s different. Transphobia is just so, so, so extreme. The hatred and the cruelty is so much more incessant.”</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>The video also took a quote out of context regarding Page’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fear of being typecast</a>, which he seems to think is just ridiculous.</p><p>“I think when people say, ‘Oh, he’ll want to play cis male characters now,’ the sensation I get is that the subtext is: They think that would be an accomplishment for me. Versus: I’m trans, I’m queer, and I want to play those roles. When I get asked, ‘Are you worried about getting typecast?’ You wouldn’t say to J-Law or Rooney Mara or someone, are they worried about getting typecast as cis straight women? But at the same time, of course I want a space where trans people are getting cast as cis characters. Of course.”</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=135 data-injectable=false>Page also shared <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what he’s learned from transitioning</a> and that his “biggest joy” of finally being able to be himself.</p><p>“I can’t overstate the biggest joy, which is really seeing yourself. I know I look different to others, but to me I’m just starting to look like myself. It’s indescribable, because I’m just like, there I am. And thank God. Here I am. So the greatest joy is just being able to feel present, literally, just to be present.”</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>Really, that’s the best any of us can hope for — and it’s amazing that Page is finally at a stage in his life where just being present isn’t an uphill battle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S0prvRoJxmrJGgsqp506GYp6OjYrKtuMioq2aokZyybr%2FHmqmippdiwbOtzaxko6elp7umxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-leaving-in-chicago-fire-season-12.html><span>←</span><span>Who is leaving in Chicago Fire season 12?</span></a>
