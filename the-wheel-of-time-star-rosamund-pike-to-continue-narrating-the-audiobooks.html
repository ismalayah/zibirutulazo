I love the narration process and am in awe of this man’s imagination!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_1047-1.jpg><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>The Great Hunt audiobook is expected to drop this Aug. 7, so we’re not going to go the whole year without new Wheel of Time content, after all. The Dragon Reborn is scheduled for next year, probably closer to the second season’s premiere date.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=false>One could say that Pike has always had a great voice for narrating audiobooks, and given the acclaim she received for narrating The Eye of the World, it’s no wonder that Amazon asked her back for more. We can only hope that she continues that streak all the way to the fourteenth and final novel, A Memory of Light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnGavmJqyrXnOn2StoZ2aerTAwKtkq6ejlrq2usNmp6KjlWLBsHnCqKWtoZ6qsm66wKupmqyZo7RuwMeeZJqtlJ68o7vOpKpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-lauers-questionable-screen-moments.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Lauer's Most Questionable On-Screen Moments</span></a>
