While no confirmation has yet been received, ARMY is looking forward to seeing all of the members together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ji-1.jpg><h2>Grammys 2022 Appearance Explored</h2><p>BTS, as usual, did not shy away from interacting with their fans as they walked the red carpet for the event. The members of the band also took the time to interact with the interviewers while posing for photos.</p><p>Fans were overjoyed to see them on screen, but some couldn’t help but notice that Jin had kept his hand hidden throughout the red carpet appearance.</p><p>In fact, Jin chose to hide his hand behind his back during his video interview. Meanwhile, another angle of the camera revealed that the singer’s hand was still wrapped.</p><h2>What Happened To Jin’s Hand?</h2><p>The bandage is the result of Jin’s surgery in March 2022. Big Hit Entertainment confirmed the news on Weverse.</p><p>The company stated to Billboard, “We would like to provide you with some information regarding BTS member Jin’s finger injury.” Jin injured his left index finger during his daily activities and went to the emergency room at a nearby hospital on Friday, March 18, for examination and treatment. He went to the doctor and was told he needed surgery because the tendons in his finger had been partially damaged. On the afternoon of Friday, March 18, he underwent surgery to repair the extensor in his left index finger.”</p><h2>What Is His Current Status?</h2><p>Jin has been doing better despite the fact that he still has the wrap on his hand. Because surgeries take time to heal, it is likely that the singer will have to wear the wrap for some time longer.</p><p>“The surgery went well according to the doctors; Jin was discharged from the hospital on the morning of Saturday, March 19, and has been resting,” Big Hit said of his surgery. For the time being, he will wear a cast to help with stabilization and recovery.”</p><p>“Jin will focus on rest and treatment to fully recover from the injury and resume his activities in good health,” they added. We will continue to provide assistance for Jin’s quick recovery, with our top priority being the health and safety of our artists.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>BTS' Jin's Hand injury</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Grammy 2022</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq7TrGSjoZ6oeqmtzZ1koqZdnL%2BiucyyZGtoYmd8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-takei-thanks-elliot-page-sharing-trans-journey.html><span>←</span><span>George Takei thanks Elliot Page for sharing his journey of coming out as trans</span></a>
