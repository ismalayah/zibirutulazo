Netflix’s insistence on sticking with just two Marvel series a year is still more than a little frustrating considering their popularity, and while we’re happy with what they’ve put out so far, they’re definitely going to have to up that number eventually in order to keep up with demand and avoid an eighteen month or two year gap between seasons.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>Regardless, watching&nbsp;<strong>The Defenders</strong> come together should be a lot of fun, and it will be interesting&nbsp;to see which other familiar faces end up being part of the team-up series in the coming months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yrsdKsoJyZXZ%2B8r7HSZqqtmaJisqytjJ2Yq66ZobmmecKopZ%2BhoqLAbr7Erayrpl2eu27Ax55knZ2WmrulsdGsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-joel-kleefisch-everything-to-know-about-the-american-politician-and-rebecca-kleefisch-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Joel Kleefisch?
