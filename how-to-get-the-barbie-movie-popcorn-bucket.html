It‚Äôs all part of the film-going experience nowadays to not only enjoy a piece of entertainment on the big screen but hoard any unique collectibles along the way.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Just like with Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, and The Flash earlier this year, the AMC theater chain is poised to release a cross-promotional popcorn container to coincide with Barbie. Since those aforementioned popcorn vessels range in cost anywhere from $25-$50, according to AMC‚Äôs website, we can hazard to guess the Barbie bucket will land somewhere in that neighborhood even though the company has not officially listed its price yet.</p><h2 id=h-what-will-the-popcorn-bucket-be-and-when-and-where-will-it-be-available data-injectable=false>What will the popcorn bucket be and when and where will it be available?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@amctheatres href=#>@amctheatres</a><p><a title=barbiethemovie href=#>#BarbieTheMovie</a> üçøvessel?!? ü§î</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Warner Bros.

Movies</a></figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Details about the Barbie popcorn bucket, such as its cost, have remained relatively elusive for now. But one thing is certain: it will be a mock-up of the blonde bombshell‚Äôs iconic pink Cadillac convertible, as had already been teased by AMC‚Äôs official TikTok page.</p><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>It‚Äôs not entirely clear if the accompanying Barbie doll seen in the brief clip will actually come with the car or if that was merely a way to show off how it can be used once you take it home to your personal toy collection. However, it‚Äôs probably safe to assume that if it does come with a doll, the merchandise will likely be on the higher end in terms of cost. For instance, the Transformers popcorn bucket and drink combo was also a vehicle ‚Äî modeled after Optimus Prime‚Äôs iconic semi-truck ‚Äî and that was priced at $50.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>In terms of when and where you can pick up Barbie‚Äôs popcorn Cadillac, it will no doubt be exclusive to AMC theaters and probably drop around the time of the movie‚Äôs release, on July 21.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=false>Once it is officially launched, these merchandise items are usually available for ordering online from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AMC‚Äôs website</a> as well. But you should bear in mind, they can sometimes sell out. Suffice it to say, if you are truly committed to picking up a Barbie Cadillac bucket, you may want to secure a ticket for the film‚Äôs Thursday night preview, on July 20, since there‚Äôs a chance they could be available then as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXam8brPErWStoJVir6K%2BwaKcZqWfq7amec%2Bop5ynoqN6o8HCpJytZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-anthony-oneal-leave-dave-ramsey-where-did-he-go-fans-wonder-about-his-whereabout-in-2022.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Why Did Anthony Oneal Leave Dave Ramsey &amp;amp; Where Did He Go?
