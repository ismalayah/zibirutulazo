Does it make sense, or does it make you bristle?"</p><p>Barra replied, "Well, it's absolutely not true. I was selected for this job based on my qualifications."</p><p>Lauer later asked, "You said in an interview not long ago that your kids said they're going to hold you accountable for one job, and that is being a mom. Given the pressures of this job at General Motors, can you do both well?"&nbsp;</p><p>Barra diplomatically responded, "You know, I think I can. I have a great team."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcnBpZYRwucCtq2akkaqys7%2BMqqyeq6SevK%2BtwaWcZquTp7KmuoympqadnqnAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./insanely-accurate-luke-cage-and-jessica-jones-cosplays-have-fans-hoping-for-mike-colter-and-krysten-ritter-return.html><span>←</span><span>Insanely accurate Luke Cage and Jessica Jones cosplays have fans hoping for Mike Colter</span></a>
