The novel was later adapted by Walt Disney Pictures which produced numerous films with the same name and similar premise, but different characters, which led to the creation of the Freaky Friday franchise.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>Fortunately, the 2003 version of Freaky Friday is available to stream on Disney Plus. So it shouldn’t be too difficult to access the film right before the sequel’s release. But what about the other Freaky Friday films? After all, Disney produced multiple titles of the same name throughout the years. Fortunately, the answer is yes, you can also watch older and newer installments of Freaky Friday on Disney Plus.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, only the 2018, 2003, and the original 1976 versions are available on the streaming platform. The 1995 version that starred Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann isn’t on the platform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdopp6pK3NZqBmq6SnsqK5jK2fnmWfp7aotc2ao2aeopqurMWMn6minJGufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eric-nangle-obituary-mechanicsburg-ohio-eric-nangle-has-died.html><span>←</span><span>Eric Nangle Obituary Mechanicsburg Ohio, Eric Nangle Has Died</span></a>
