<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Restless movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2011)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Enoch (<a href=#>Henry Hopper</a>, son of Dennis) is obsessed with death. When we first see him, he is drawing a chalk outline on the floor around his body — a murder scene technique that works without words to tell us what we need to know. Annabel (<a href=#>Mia Wasikowska</a>) has a brain tumor and has been given three months to live.</p><p>Tenderly, shyly, they develop an affection for each other. As it grows, it helps him renew his interest in living. She sets one condition: Her illness is not to be the subject of their relationship. Because her death is near in her future, she wants to simply ignore it, and in the weeks she has remaining, she wants to experience, as much as she can, the first real romance of her young life.</p><p>There is a third major character, an inexplicable one, a friend of Enoch's named <a href=#>Hiroshi Takahashi</a> (<a href=#>Ryo Kase</a>), who died in World War II as a kamikaze pilot. The nature of this character is unclear. Reincarnated? Van Sant wisely doesn't explain and simply uses him in a matter-of-fact way as someone who is there. I don't believe kamikaze pilots were in love with death, but simply willing to give up their lives for their country. Perhaps his presence indicates that Enoch can travel in some sense to that undiscovered country, from whose bourn no traveler returns.</p><p>Annabel has a confidante, too: Her sister, Elizabeth (<a href=#>Schuyler Fisk</a>), who is wary of this strange boy who has come tentatively stumbling into Annabel's complicated life. You can't always trust a man, Elizabeth counsels, but Annabel knows she can trust this one.</p><p>All of the performances are pitched correctly. Nobody pushes too hard. Nobody underlines anything. Perhaps calmed by Van Sant, the characters seem peaceful, not troubled (as they should be). Few people can be this composed in the face of death. The most problematic character is Hiroshi, who has literally been dropped in from nowhere. Because he speaks English and knows about Nagasaki (which would have happened after his death), perhaps he is entirely an imaginary friend? In any event, Hiroshi and Enoch speak in matter-of-fact terms, as ordinary best pals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46rnKysnJrAtHmRaWhq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marcela-iglesias-dead-news-what-happened-to-onlyfans-model-and-where-is-she-now-663442-html.html><span>←</span><span>Marcela Iglesias Dead News | What Happened To OnlyFans Model And Where Is She Now</span></a>
