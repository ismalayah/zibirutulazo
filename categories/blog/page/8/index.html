In 2014, Lauer faced criticism following an interview with General Motors CEO Mary Barra, in which he asked her, "There are some people who are speculating that you also got this job as a woman and as a mom, because people in General Motors knew that this company was in for a very tough time and, as a woman and a mom, you could present a softer image and softer face as this company goes through this horrible episode.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Wheel of Time star Rosamund Pike to continue narrating the audiobooks</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>

From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.
Route 45 (Japanese: ４５ばんどうろ Route 45) is a route in eastern Johto, connecting Blackthorn City and Route 46. It is also known as Mountain Road (Japanese: マウンテンロード Mountain Road). The route can only be entered from the northern terminus, as the steep ledges that one can jump over make traveling northward towards Blackthorn City impossible. One of the entrances to Dark Cave lies at its northern edge.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sanya Malhotra movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Aug 28, 2024</time>

Everyone here is a sucker for a good 'Which Pokémon are you?' quiz, but if you're like me you're never that convinced with the results; instead, I thought it would be interesting to have a crack at figuring out what we think of ourselves. I’ve worked up a list of personality traits associated with each type on the basis of the trainers of that type, along with the playstyles of the Pokémon themselves (easier said than done when two trainers of the same type can have wildly different personas!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Tall Is William Shatner?</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

Chances are that you first encountered William Shatner when he was squaring up to something or someone. He could have been in his Captain Kirk uniform battling a two-meter Gorn in the classic Star Trek episode “Arena” or perhaps sparring with his best friend and partner-in-law James Spader on Boston Legal as the ever-quotable Denny Crane. He could have even been cleaning up the streets of Los Angeles in the early 1980s as the uncompromising Sergeant T.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Hubble 3D movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2010)</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

The fact that this footage exists at all is enough to justify it. Someone like me would need to see it. I would be happier if the astronauts had been less confident and casual. I suppose that's the astronaut culture. Could they have ... acted? Pretended to be tense, scared, deadly serious? They're like the crew on the Star Trek command deck, which most of the time might as well be controlling the traffic grid of a subway system.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/7/>← Prev Page</a>
