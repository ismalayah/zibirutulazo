Majestic, romantic, searching strains seem at first peculiarly incongruous with the action on screen. “You need to tell her now,” an attractive middle-aged woman sitting on a bed tells a paunchy, balding, despondent-looking fellow some years older than her; his submissive response is rather less than zealous. Another couple, this one a woman in late middle age who’s with a younger man, is then seen kissing by a tree near a nondescript office building; he, too, seems the more ardent one in the exchange.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cate Windelborn Obituary, A Precious Soul Gone Too Soon</h2><time>May 11, 2024</time>

The film's story is an example of what The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw calls "that emerging post-'Wicked' genre, the revisionist-backstory fairytale," but it's affecting. It has a&nbsp;primordial edge that the clumsy filmmaking can't blunt. There are moments in "Maleficent" that are profoundly disturbing, in the way that ancient myths and Grimm fairy tales are disturbing. They strike to the heart of human experience and create the kinds of memories that young children—young girls particularly—will obsess over, because on some level they'll know, even without the benefit of adult experience, that the film is telling them a horrible sort of truth.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Steve Jones Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</h2><time>May 11, 2024</time>

It’s on this stage that Josephine Decker’s “Madeline’s Madeline” makes her debut. Its main character, Madeline (Helena Howard), is a mentally ill, biracial teenager doing what teenagers do: fight constantly with their authority figures, discover what they’re passionate about and figure out who they are. Only, in Madeline’s case, she resorts to acting out against her overprotective, sometimes judgmental mother, Regina (Miranda July).
