I look up articles about me a couple times a day. I read all the comments one by one too, only because I’m curious about the stories surrounding me. However, I’m now slowly practicing not to take comments to heart.”</p><p>When the interviewer protests, “You aren’t ugly at all,” she responds, “I like my ordinary looks. There are people who think this look is refreshing too.”</p><p>Shin Hye Sun’s so-called “ordinary” appearance is rather a natural beauty that allows her to seem more approachable to the public. After debuting in KBS2 drama “<a href=#>School 2013</a>,” the actress appeared in film “A Violent Prosecutor,” where she shot a famous kissing scene with actor <a href=#>Kang Dong Won</a>, and in drama “<a href=#>Five Children</a>,” where she proved her potential of being a romantic-comedy lead.</p><p>She states, “I’m still an unknown rookie actress. It’s my dream to work as an actress all my life. To achieve that, I have to discipline myself well from now on.”</p><p>She continues, “It’s been three years since I debuted. I didn’t dream of it to be this strenuous when I was younger, but this job is very fun in reality too. I like that I meet people, and I’m happy when I act. I’ll work hard to become a timeless and versatile actress, so please watch out for me.”</p><p>Source (<a href=#>1</a>)</p><p>How does this article make you feel?</p><p>Share it on</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvOpqeiZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVZIV6gI9raLCooGTAqbXNZp%2BynV2owq95yKylrWWSpMGpsdGem2abn6K6prrTrGScmZyhtq%2BzjK6epbFdo7yju8Oy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./good-and-care-website-reviews.html><span>←</span><span>Is Good and Care Website Legit?
