They reward artistic and technical achievement across filmmaking, music, and acting, but the top awards have remained consistent for many years.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>Most headlines are saved for the Best Picture, Best Director, and actors and actresses in both lead and supporting roles. While an increasing number of entertainment awards have embraced gender-neutral categories, there’s no sign the Oscars will change their top categories any time soon.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>The outstanding performances in this top-tier list of award-winning actors span 90 years. From 1931 (when the sixth ceremony was held in a hotel) to 2021 (just before the Covid-19 pandemic posed one of the most significant challenges filmmaking has ever faced).</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Despite its exclusivity, this list includes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a range of distinctive actors</a>, although there’s plenty of room for it to become more representative in future years. It shouldn’t be long until there are some significant changes. Despite the 19 phenomenal actors on this list who’ve left us since picking up their last award, the majority are still alive and working.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>And, who knows? With how gifted this class of nominations is for the 2024 Oscars, perhaps these stats will alter when the envelopes are opened on March 10.</p><h2 id=h-which-actor-has-the-most-wins-at-the-oscars data-injectable=false>Which actor has the most wins at the Oscars?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-3168950.jpg><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>Legendary American actress Katharine Hepburn stands out from the crowd with four wins from 12 nominations. All her awards came in the Best Actress category. She won for Morning Glory (1933), Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967), The Lion in Winter (1968), and On Golden Pond (1981). Hepburn collected the first and last of her four Oscars 48 years apart, famously skipping out on attending the ceremony multiple times.</p><h2 id=h-who-s-closing-in data-injectable=false>Who’s closing in?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2ACD6967-E0CE-4B84-A0FC-9DC4CB895A09.jpeg><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true>Six actors have picked up three Oscars for acting, three male and three female. Of those six, two are no longer with us. Walter Brennan picked up three wins in the best supporting category in just four years, from a total of four nominations. The films he won with were Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938), and The Westerner (1940).</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, we also lost the brilliant Ingrid Bergman in 1982. She picked up the Best Actress prize for<strong> </strong>Gaslight (1944) and Anastasia (1956), from seven nominations. In 1974, she claimed the Best Supporting Actress award for Murder on the Orient Express.</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>The contenders who could still match or beat Hepburn’s record are naturally household names.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>Jack Nicholson has three wins from 12 nominations so far, although the rumor is that he called time on acting in 2018. His impressive career took in two Best Actor Oscars for One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) and As Good as It Gets (1997). His third was a Best Supporting Actor statue for 1983’s Terms of Endearment.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Daniel Day-Lewis has three wins from six noms, despite his frequent mini-retirements. Day-Lewis’s three Best Actor awards came for My Left Foot (1989), There Will Be Blood (2007), and Lincoln (2012). He retired after completing 2017’s Phantom Thread (one of his Oscar nominations).</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>Things are a little more competitive on the Best Actress side. Meryl Streep has received an astounding 21 nominations and received the award on three occasions. She won the Best Actress award for Sophie’s Choice (1982) and The Iron Lady (2011). Before that, she also picked up the Best Supporting Actress prize for Kramer vs. Kramer in 1979.</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>However, the big surprise is that Meryl Streep might not be first in line to match Katherine Hepburn’s haul. She has stiff competition in Frances McDormand, who has already picked up four Oscars, although only three in the acting categories. Her most recent Academy Award was for Best Picture as a producer of Nomadland in 2020. For acting, she has picked up three wins from six nominations: Best Actress prizes for Fargo in 1996, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2017, and Nomadland in 2020.</p><h2 id=h-which-actors-have-won-two-oscars data-injectable=false>Which actors have won two Oscars?&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/denzel-washington.jpg><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>After this top tier of Academy Award winners, the list of actors in the next tier is substantially longer.
