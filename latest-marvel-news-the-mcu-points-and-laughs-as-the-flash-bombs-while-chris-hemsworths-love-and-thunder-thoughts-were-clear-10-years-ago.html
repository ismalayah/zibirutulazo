After initial projections foresaw a healthy $100 million opening, estimates then dropped to $80 million, $70 million, and now here we are at the film looking likely to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">achieve around $64 million over its first three days</a> ($72 million, if you include Juneteenth), which puts it lower than Black Adam. It will no doubt earn more than Shazam! Fury of the Gods, but given that much more was riding on The Flash, its lackluster performance hits harder.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Proving time travel is real, Chris Hemsworth made his thoughts on Thor: Love and Thunder clear… 10 years ago</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/thor-love-and-thunder-1.jpg><p data-characters=676 data-current-count=976 data-injectable=true>Marvel fans were shocked when Chris Hemsworth recently came clean that he agreed with the rest of us that Thor: Love and Thunder wasn’t as good as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it could’ve been and became “too silly.”</a> This shouldn’t have come as a surprise, however, seeing as the Aussie hunk made his thoughts clear on the film’s plot… 10 years ago. In resurfaced comments that are hilarious in hindsight, Hemsworth explained his relief that the MCU had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ditched a traditional aspect of Thor’s character</a>, calling it “not too cool.” Well, maybe Taika Waititi should’ve listened to Young Hemsworth as his prediction turned out to be spot-on.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“Go for the violence”: Kevin Feige is the reason Secret Invasion is the darkest MCU Disney Plus series yet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/secret-invasion.jpg><p data-characters=556 data-current-count=856 data-injectable=true>As yet another reminder that Kevin Feige truly is behind everything in the MCU, Secret Invasion <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">director Ali Selim has revealed</a> that the brief to make the incoming Samuel L. Jackson vehicle darker and grittier than anything we’ve seen before from Marvel came from the studio prez himself. In fact, according to Selim, Feige encouraged the production team to “go for the violence.” The man who made the Marvel Universe the biggest family-friendly franchise in the world said that? Are we sure Feige hasn’t been replaced by a Skrull?</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>Secret Invasion might be dark and gritty, but there’s still room for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wholesomeness behind-the-scenes interactions between an on-screen father and daughter</a>.
