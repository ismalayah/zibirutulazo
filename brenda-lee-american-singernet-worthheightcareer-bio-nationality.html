Her father was frequently seeking work between Atlanta and Augusta, therefore she grew up in poverty. She shared a bed with her brother and sister as a child in a series of residences that lacked running water. The family did attend local Baptist churches on a regular basis, and she began singing solos every Sunday.</p><p>She earned first place in her school’s talent show contest at the age of five, singing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game.” Lee’s father perished in a construction accident when she was eight years old. Lee became the principal breadwinner in her family over the next few years once she began singing and entertaining. In 1955, her mother remarried, and the family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio.</p><h2>Professional life and Career :</h2><p>Lee began appearing on the country music show “TV Ranch” in Atlanta when she was nine years old. Lee began performing at the Jimmie Skinner Music Center, where her stepfather worked, after the family relocated to Cincinnati. Soon later, the family relocated back to Georgia, where Lee continued to make regular radio appearances. Her big break came in February 1955, when she appeared on “Ozark Jubilee” and sang “Jambalaya.” She agreed to a five-year contract with the show, but she broke it in 1957. Lee joined with Decca Records in 1956 and issued two Christmas singles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hqdefault.jpg><p>Lee re-established herself as a country music performer in the 1970s.
