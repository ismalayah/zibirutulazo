Netflix has taken a clumsy stab at riding the wave of Pedro Pascal‘s ever-increasing popularity.

What are the most addictive drugs? This question seems simple, but the answer depends on whom you ask.
From the points of view of different researchers, the potential for a drug to be addictive can be judged in terms of the harm it causes, the street value of the drug, the extent to which the drug activates the brain's dopamine system, how pleasurable people report the drug to be, the degree to which the drug causes withdrawal symptoms, and how easily a person trying the drug will become hooked.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Amityville II: The Possession movie review (1982)</h2><time>Jun 2, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../amityville-ii-the-possession-1982.html></a>
"Amityville II" is actually a prequel, then, instead of a sequel, since it tells what happened in the house before the Lutzes entered the picture. The movie itself is vague about exactly when it's set, however, and although "Amityville Horror" came out in 1979, this prequel contains 1982 automobiles.
The movie opens with a foggy shot of the house, with those eerie attic windows gleaming like diabolical eyes. There is a "</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ash Is Purest White movie review (2019)</h2><time>Jun 2, 2024</time>

Bin and Qiao are soon revealed to be rather more serious people than these first impressions indicate. Qiao has an ailing dad whose loss of a profession—he worked in a mine that’s soon closing—isn’t helping his disposition. Bin likes a peaceable rule, even as he offers to help out an elder operator who’s delving into real estate. “Some assholes are saying my villas are haunted,” the older guy complains.

The title is an enigma, creating an uneasy miasma over the whole proceedings. On the wall hangs a sepia-toned photograph of Victorian-era explorer Henry Morton Stanley (of "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?" fame), and Maria is drawn to it, staring at Stanley like she's searching for a message. On a nearby stand sits a mannequin head wearing a pith helmet. The helmet comes into play in one of the challenges. Henry Morton Stanley was an integral part of the Belgian colonization of the Congo, and in 1883 he founded a small trading post, which eventually morphed into a city called Stanleyville in his honor (the city was re-named Kisangani).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chrissy Teigen Daughter, Luna Simone Stephens Is Single and Inherits Hefty Net Worth</h2><time>May 31, 2024</time>

Ruby and Josh both have off-screen partners who make their presence known through phone messages or Outlook reminders of an upcoming Skype call.
