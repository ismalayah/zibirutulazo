Marc Forschino Obituary, Death Cause – In the close to two decades that I had the privilege of knowing Marc Forschino, he became more than just a friend – he was a lifeline during some of the toughest moments of my life. Marc had a unique ability to navigate through the colossal challenges that life throws at us, emerging as a beacon of support and a true savior. While many may have experienced his remarkable generosity, Marc’s impact was particularly profound when it came to those monumental problems that could have derailed an entire existence.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Grissom Gang movie review (1971)</h2><time>Aug 4, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../the-grissom-gang-1971.html></a>
Why this sort of material should be fascinating to American directors just now is hard to say. John Frankenheimer, for example, covered similar backwoods territory in "I Walk the Line," and now comes Aldrich. The one thing Aldrich has going for him, however, is a fine sense of depraved melodrama. He seems at home working with characters who come out of the Gothic novel via Screen Romances, and his early films in this genre include "</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is leaving in Chicago Fire season 12?</h2><time>Aug 4, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../who-is-leaving-in-chicago-fire-season-12.html></a>
No show reaches 12 years on the air without some cast changes, and Chicago Fire has certainly seen its fair share of hellos and goodbyes. But the NBC drama’s season 12 premiere still caught fans by surprise with its multiple character exits. Recommended Videos One reason avid viewers of the series that kicked off the uber-popular Chicago franchise were excited for the new run was the return of Taylor Kinney’s Kelly Severide after a brief absence in the back half of season 11, but unfortunately, the latest episodes will also see a couple of other favorites bid farewell to the Firehouse 51 crew.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>George Takei thanks Elliot Page for sharing his journey of coming out as trans</h2><time>Aug 3, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../an-american-werewolf-in-paris-1997.html></a>
The new movie involves three callow Americans on a "daredevil tour'' of Europe. Played by Tom Everett Scott (of That Thing You Do!), Vince Vieluf and Phil Buckman, they climb the Eiffel Tower by moonlight, only to find a young woman (Julie Delpy) about to leap to her death. They talk, she leaps, and Scott leaps after her, luckily while tethered to a bungee cord. (Hint: Always be sure the other end of a bungee line is tied to something else before tying this end to yourself.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Candy Mafia | Bulbagarden</h2><time>Aug 2, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../warnermedia-merger-disney-buying-dc.html></a>
There’s been a line of hopeful, and some would say misplaced, optimism that the upcoming merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery could result in the restoration and resurrection of the SnyderVerse.
Recommended Videos Of course, we’re talking about a potential $100 billion deal between two massive corporations where most of the major players involved don’t even have a background in the feature film business, but that hasn’t stopped speculation from making the rounds that whoever takes charge will boot out the old regime and welcome Zack Snyder back into the fold based entirely on the audience goodwill towards a single HBO Max exclusive.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/15/>← Prev Page</a>
