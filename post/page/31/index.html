"Jekyll & Hyde" has other predecessors, of course. The credits say the movie was "inspired by the Robert Louis Stevenson novel," which is a little like saying "Fantasy Island" was inspired by Robinson Crusoe. The press releases have the chutzpah to actually print the following sentence: "Mark Blankfield (of ABC's 'Fridays' fame) follows movie greats John Barrymore, Fredric March and Spencer Tracy in assuming the title roles."

<a href=../../../modern-family-review-australia-season-5-episode-20.html></a>
Recommended Videos It is fitting that Modern Family’s “Australia” begins with a shot of Luke, upside down, trying to impress his family with a handstand.
