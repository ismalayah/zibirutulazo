And while renowned romantic<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a></strong> is certainly no stranger when it comes to boarding the love train, perhaps acclaimed athlete <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Kelce</a></strong> needed an extra push from teammate <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Mahomes</a></strong> in regards to impressing Swift while she attended a recent Chiefs football game.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>During a game between the Chiefs and the Bears yesterday afternoon, Mahomes, who serves as the towering quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, made sure to lend a helping hand in the passing game as he assisted Kelce, who serves as the team’s star tight end, in impressing Swift. During the broadcast, Swift was showcased <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sitting beside Kelce’s mom Donna</a>, with the duo even celebrating when Kelce caught an explosive touchdown in the end zone from Mahomes in the third quarter.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Following the game, Mahomes was asked in an interview about the pressure he might have felt once he was informed that Swift was in attendance for the game. Mahomes jokingly explained that he felt some pressure, which actually motivated him to “get it to Trav” so that he could score in front of Swift after the ever-popular tight end invited her to the game.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=false>This entire situation unfolded after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">months of speculation</a> as to whether or not Kelce and Swift are an actual item or if the pair is simply only in the dating stages as of right now. Either way, there’s absolutely no denying the nation is wrapped up in their dynamic right now — which even includes the quarterback of the Chiefs putting on his Cupid hat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2brfNnq5moV2drqV506hkoJ2kYsGpsYybmKWkXam8bsDRmq2iq12grq%2B%2FwKxknKGkrnqktMienaxloaqus8DEq5mam5tivaLA0aKapGWdlrWwucSsZLCZo2LBqbGMqZyrnpWYwW7DyKeeppmeYraveceeo6mhnpx6tb7Ar6CsZZuauaSxjKKkqaqVqMBuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./buddy-teevans-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Buddy Teevans Net Worth</span></a>
