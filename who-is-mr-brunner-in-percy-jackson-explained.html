But what is Mr. Brunner’s whole deal?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-mr-brunner-in-percy-jackson-from-legend-to-disney-plus data-injectable=false>Who is Mr. Brunner in Percy Jackson? From legend to Disney Plus</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>His whole deal, it turns out, is that he’s a centaur – a pretty great centaur, too. In the Camp Halfblood Chronicles and in the Greek mythology from which they take their inspiration, Chiron is sort of the go-to guy for training fresh-faced heroes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>In the original stories, Chiron was the son of the Kronos, the baby-eating president of Titans, basically. Because this is Greek mythology and everything is at least a little bit uncomfortable, he gets the horsier half of his body thanks to the fact that his dad was a pretty pony when Chiron was conceived. Mythology is full of stuff like this. They didn’t have a lot of outlets for this kind of thing in ancient Athens.</p><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>While the Chiron of legend died after an embarrassing whoopsie with an arrow dipped in Hydra blood during an unforeseen centaur stampede, in the Camp Halfblood Chronicles, he is gifted with immortality by Zeus, presumably back <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">before he turned into Russell Crowe</a>. Unlike basically every other mentor figure in post-Campbell storytelling, he doesn’t even die at the end of the second act – He lives on, well past the average lifespan of most men and horses, on the condition that he keeps cranking out new heroes like Achilles, Jason, and Hercules.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>In the 21st century, Chiron finds a new, unlikely pupil: Percy Jackson, a desperately under-qualified demigod of uncertain parentage who might – just might – be the “prophesied chosen one” that most YA novels are built upon. Disguising himself in an enchanted wheelchair and calling himself Mr. Brunner, Chiron keeps a weather eye on young Percy, even providing secret weapons that are somehow exactly as mighty as both a pen and a sword in the blossoming young hero’s hour of need.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>The Disney Plus iteration of Percy Jackson sees Chiron/Mr. Brunner played by Glynn Turman, AKA Mayor Clarence Royce from the third season of The Wire, or Dr. Redman from Freddy’s Nightmares, if you’re nasty. The first movie in 2010’s false-start film series saw Pierce Brosnan in the role, while the little-remembered second entry passed the part on to Ted Lasso’s Anthony Head.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeUnsCvsdhorqGnXZ7AbrnRZpmrrZ6jsrN5yKdkqZ2imMZutsCcoqynnmKyubzLmqCnnZRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michaela-fialova-age-meet-the-huntress-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Michaela Fialov Age: Meet The Huntress On Instagram</span></a>
