Just to prove the point, this week <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyoncé</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay-Z</a></strong> bought a brand new home — and it made headlines. Although a new home purchase is celebratory in all strata of society, this one is actually newsworthy. That is because this is not a casual, run-of-the-mill home purchase, this is a purchase of one of the most expensive homes in California. Ever. So, we had to know: What made this casual seaside getaway so spectacular? We dug deep to get a first look at one of the most glamorous homes ever purchased, at least in the Golden State.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=657 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyoncé and Jay-Z met in 2000</a> and became an official power couple in 2001. The pair is known for their glamorous lifestyle of exotic vacations, extravagant acquisitions, and now even the most expensive homes. We love it. Yet this week, Beyoncé and Jay-Z have even outdone, well, themselves. This week, the power couple set a new record, and no, we aren’t just talking about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyoncé’s Grammy wins</a> — the dynamic duo just made headlines for purchasing the most expensive California home to date. The previous record holder? Them, probably. Oh, and Jeff Bezos. Here’s everything we know so far about their Malibu Beyoncé dream home.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=879 data-injectable=true>The newest acquisition of “Jayonce” is a beautiful 30,000-square-foot home (although some reports say 40,000) right along the Pacific Ocean in star-studded Malibu. For comparison’s sake, an average city apartment is about 600 square feet. So, these two are definitely living in the lap of luxury. The home was designed by Japanese Pritzker Prize winner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tadao Ando </a>and originally was built for the soap opera heir Bill Bell Jr., whose parents William and Lee Bell were the creators of the popular soaps The Young and The Restless and The Bold and The Beautiful.</p><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>Every inch of the home is rumored to be layered with luxurious details and fine touches, and it reportedly took over a decade to build. Ando is also known for designing the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth</a> and several other celebrity hot spots such as a home for Richard Sachs which now belongs to Kanye West. Ando’s designs are known to be unique and oh-so-glamorous. Here is a sneak peek of the home that Bey and Jay just purchased. Images can be seen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> on the builder’s site, in this tribute to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">modernist architecture, </a>and in this Instagram post.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Maria Baibakova (@baibakovart)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=807 data-current-count=1107 data-injectable=true>So, what is the actual price tag of this luxurious home? $200 million — a new California record. It tops Jeff Bezos’ $160 million Beverly Hills bachelor pad and Marc Andreesen’s $177 million Malibu home. The couple also has a $6.8 million home in Manhattan’s trendy Tribeca, and one worth $88 million in Beverly Hills. The acquisition of their latest home, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, places them in the number two spot for the most expensive home purchase in the United States. The number one spot goes to Kenneth Griffin, CEO of Citadel for his $238 million New York City penthouse. Although $200 million is quite the price tag, the couple’s collective net worth sits at close to $3 billion so the Malibu home is simply a drop in the bucket for these two beloved billionaires.</p><p data-characters=580 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=false>Grammy wins, new homes — this power couple is breaking records all over the place! It’s no surprise even from their first collaboration in 2003’s Bonnie and Clyde, we all knew this duo was destined for greatness. In fact, we fully expect them to be sliding into the number one most expensive house in the U.S. spot any day now, and after that, probably the world. So, let’s all raise our glasses to the happy couple and their latest claim to fame, the most expensive home in California and the second most expensive home in the country. Congrats, you two!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8WiqaysXaG8sLeMmqtmmpWuvK%2BvxGaYp5xdn666edmsZKedp2K1sLnEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coyote-peterson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-512060-html.html><span>←</span><span>Coyote Peterson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
